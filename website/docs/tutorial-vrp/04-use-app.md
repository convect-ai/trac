# Use the app

There are two major types of entities to manage for a published app -- datasets and runs.

Datasets are where the input of algorithm lives. E.g., in a vehicle routing problem, it incldues the location information you would like your fleet to serve, and their time window constraints if there are so.

Runs are invokations of an app.

## Managing data

To create a new dataset, you can use mutliple data backends, including Google Sheets, Database, etc.
We plan to support more backends in the future.

## Managing runs

To create a new run, select a dataset to use as the input to the app, and also configure the parameters.

Once the run is completed, you can view the logs and results of the run.
