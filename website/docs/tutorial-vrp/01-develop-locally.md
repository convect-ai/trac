## Develop the solution locally

The first step is to develop your data science solution locally on your computer.
This does not differ at all with normal development journey. Normally, one can choose to write scripts or notebooks.

The scripts/notebooks usually take in a few input files (csv is one popular format), conduct some computation logic (such as training a machine learning model, searching for a viable way to route a fleet of vehicles), then output some results.

One will follow this norm and make sure the scripts can run smoothly on the local computer.
